# 💰 Payment System Complete Guide

## 🔍 How Payment System Works

### **Flow Diagram:**
```
User Form → Backend API → Cashfree → Payment Gateway → Database → Success Page
```

### **Detailed Process:**

1. **User Input** (Frontend)
   - Name, Email, Phone, Amount, UPI ID, LPU ID
   - Validation happens in browser

2. **Order Creation** (Backend)
   - Generates unique `order_id` (UUID)
   - Creates transaction in MongoDB (status: PENDING)
   - Calls Cashfree API with order details
   - Returns `payment_session_id` to frontend

3. **Payment Gateway** (Cashfree)
   - Frontend opens Cashfree hosted page
   - User sees "Vibranta Student Organization" as business name
   - User completes payment via UPI/Card/NetBanking

4. **Payment Processing** (Cashfree + Backend)
   - Cashfree processes payment
   - Sends webhook to your server (real-time notification)
   - User redirected to success page
   - Backend verifies payment and updates database

5. **Completion** (Database + User)
   - Transaction status updated to SUCCESS/FAILED
   - User sees confirmation page
   - Email notifications sent (if configured)

## 🎯 Money Flow

**FROM:** Customer's bank account/UPI
**TO:** Your Cashfree merchant account  
**BUSINESS NAME:** "Vibranta Student Organization"
**SETTLEMENT:** Cashfree transfers to your bank (T+1 or T+2 days)

## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Get Live Cashfree Account**
1. Complete business verification on Cashfree
2. Get LIVE API keys (not TEST keys)
3. Configure business name and logo
4. Set up bank account for settlements

### **Step 2: VPS Setup**
```bash
# On your VPS, run:
git clone https://github.com/Anurag-Basuri/vib_club.git
cd vib_club
chmod +x deploy-vps.sh
./deploy-vps.sh
```

### **Step 3: Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Copy production template
cp backend/.env.production.template backend/.env

# Edit with your actual values:
nano backend/.env
```

**Critical values to update:**
- `CASHFREE_APP_ID` = Your live Cashfree app ID
- `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` = Your live Cashfree secret
- `MONGODB_URI` = Your production database
- `FRONTEND_URL` = https://yourdomain.com
- `CASHFREE_RETURN_URL` = https://yourdomain.com/payment-success
- `CASHFREE_NOTIFY_URL` = https://yourdomain.com/api/cashfree/webhook

### **Step 4: Domain & SSL**
```bash
# Update domain in Nginx config
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/vib-club

# Get SSL certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

### **Step 5: Test Payment**
1. Start with ₹1 test payment
2. Check database for transaction record
3. Verify webhook is working
4. Test payment failure scenario
